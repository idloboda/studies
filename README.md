# Study Repository

Welcome to my study repository! This is a place where I'm documenting my learning journey and working on various projects as I continue to grow my skills. At the moment, I'm focusing on Python, but my ultimate goal is to become an AI developer.

I'll be adding more information about specific projects as they evolve. This is just the beginning, so stay tuned for more updates!

### Current Learning Topics
