### **SOLID Principles**

The **SOLID** principles are five design principles that help developers create more maintainable and scalable software. These principles are used to ensure good object-oriented design and programming practices. Hereâ€™s a quick recap of each principle along with implementation examples:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
   - **Definition**: A class should have **only one reason to change**, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.
   - **Purpose**: This principle helps keep classes **simple and focused**. When a class has only one responsibility, it becomes easier to maintain and modify, as changes are isolated to a specific purpose.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```python
     class Order:
         def __init__(self, order_id, items):
             self.order_id = order_id
             self.items = items  # List of items in the order

     class OrderPrinter:
         def print_order(self, order: Order):
             print(f"Order ID: {order.order_id}")
             for item in order.items:
                 print(f"- {item}")
     
     # Creating an order and printing it
     order = Order(1, ["Item1", "Item2", "Item3"])
     order_printer = OrderPrinter()
     order_printer.print_order(order)
     ```

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
   - **Definition**: Software entities (e.g., classes, functions) should be **open for extension** but **closed for modification**.
   - **Purpose**: This ensures that you can **add new functionality** without altering existing code, which helps prevent bugs.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```python
     from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

     class Discount(ABC):
         @abstractmethod
         def calculate(self, amount):
             pass

     class NoDiscount(Discount):
         def calculate(self, amount):
             return amount

     class PercentageDiscount(Discount):
         def __init__(self, percent):
             self.percent = percent
         
         def calculate(self, amount):
             return amount * (1 - self.percent / 100)
     
     # Applying different discounts
     amount = 1000
     no_discount = NoDiscount()
     percentage_discount = PercentageDiscount(10)
     print("No Discount:", no_discount.calculate(amount))
     print("Percentage Discount (10%):", percentage_discount.calculate(amount))
     ```

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
   - **Definition**: Objects of a superclass should be **replaceable with objects of a subclass** without affecting the correctness of the program.
   - **Purpose**: This ensures that derived classes are **fully compatible** with their base classes, allowing for better substitutability.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```python
     class Rectangle:
         def __init__(self, width, height):
             self.width = width
             self.height = height
         
         def get_area(self):
             return self.width * self.height

     class Square(Rectangle):
         def __init__(self, side_length):
             super().__init__(side_length, side_length)
     
     # Using Rectangle and Square
     rectangle = Rectangle(10, 20)
     square = Square(15)
     print("Rectangle Area:", rectangle.get_area())
     print("Square Area:", square.get_area())
     ```

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
   - **Definition**: A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use. Instead, many **small, specific interfaces** are better than one large, general-purpose interface.
   - **Purpose**: This principle helps reduce **unnecessary dependencies** in your code by ensuring that interfaces are **tailored** to specific clients.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```python
     from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

     class Printer(ABC):
         @abstractmethod
         def print_document(self, document):
             pass

     class Scanner(ABC):
         @abstractmethod
         def scan_document(self, document):
             pass

     class MultiFunctionPrinter(Printer, Scanner):
         def print_document(self, document):
             print(f"Printing: {document}")
         
         def scan_document(self, document):
             print(f"Scanning: {document}")

     class SimplePrinter(Printer):
         def print_document(self, document):
             print(f"Printing: {document}")
     
     # Using different printer types
     printer = SimplePrinter()
     printer.print_document("Document1")

     multi_printer = MultiFunctionPrinter()
     multi_printer.print_document("Document2")
     multi_printer.scan_document("Document3")
     ```

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
   - **Definition**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on **abstractions**. Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.
   - **Purpose**: This reduces the **tight coupling** between high-level and low-level components, making the code more flexible and reusable.
   - **Code Example**:
     ```python
     class MessageSender(ABC):
         @abstractmethod
         def send(self, message):
             pass

     class EmailSender(MessageSender):
         def send(self, message):
             print(f"Sending email: {message}")

     class SMSSender(MessageSender):
         def send(self, message):
             print(f"Sending SMS: {message}")

     class NotificationService:
         def __init__(self, sender: MessageSender):
             self.sender = sender
         
         def notify(self, message):
             self.sender.send(message)
     
     # Sending notifications
     email_sender = EmailSender()
     sms_sender = SMSSender()
     notification_service = NotificationService(email_sender)
     notification_service.notify("Hello via Email!")

     notification_service_sms = NotificationService(sms_sender)
     notification_service_sms.notify("Hello via SMS!")
     ```

These principles help developers write **modular, maintainable, and testable** code, reducing the risk of bugs and making it easier to extend the system in the future.
