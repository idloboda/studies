### **OOP Principles**

Object-Oriented Programming (**OOP**) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which contain both data and methods that operate on the data. The four main principles of OOP are **Encapsulation**, **Abstraction**, **Inheritance**, and **Polymorphism**. Here’s a quick recap of each principle with examples:

1. **Encapsulation**
   - **Definition**: Encapsulation is the concept of **bundling data** (attributes) and **methods** (functions) that operate on that data within one unit, typically a class. It also involves restricting direct access to some of the object's components, which is achieved through **access modifiers** (like private or protected attributes).
   - **Purpose**: This helps protect the data from unintended interference and misuse.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     class BankAccount:
         def __init__(self, balance):
             self.__balance = balance  # Private attribute
         
         def deposit(self, amount):
             if amount > 0:
                 self.__balance += amount
         
         def get_balance(self):
             return self.__balance

     # Creating a BankAccount object
     account = BankAccount(1000)
     account.deposit(500)
     print(account.get_balance())  # Output: 1500
     ```

2. **Abstraction**
   - **Definition**: Abstraction is the concept of **hiding complex implementation details** and showing only the essential features of an object. It helps to reduce complexity and allows the programmer to focus on interactions at a high level.
   - **Purpose**: To simplify the interaction with complex systems.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

     class Vehicle(ABC):
         @abstractmethod
         def start_engine(self):
             pass
     
     class Car(Vehicle):
         def start_engine(self):
             print("Car engine started.")

     # Creating a Car object
     car = Car()
     car.start_engine()  # Output: Car engine started.
     ```

3. **Inheritance**
   - **Definition**: Inheritance is the mechanism by which one class (**child/subclass**) can **inherit properties and methods** from another class (**parent/superclass**). This allows for **code reuse** and the establishment of a hierarchical relationship between classes.
   - **Purpose**: To promote code reusability and establish a natural hierarchy.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     class Animal:
         def eat(self):
             print("This animal eats food.")
     
     class Dog(Animal):
         def bark(self):
             print("The dog barks.")

     # Creating a Dog object
     dog = Dog()
     dog.eat()  # Output: This animal eats food.
     dog.bark()  # Output: The dog barks.
     ```

4. **Polymorphism**
   - **Definition**: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as **objects of a common super class**. It refers to the ability to use a **single interface** to represent different underlying data types. In OOP, polymorphism is often achieved through **method overriding** and **method overloading**.
   - **Purpose**: To allow for **flexible and reusable code** that can operate on objects of different types.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     class Bird:
         def make_sound(self):
             print("Some generic bird sound")
     
     class Sparrow(Bird):
         def make_sound(self):
             print("Chirp chirp")
     
     class Crow(Bird):
         def make_sound(self):
             print("Caw caw")

     # Polymorphism in action
     birds = [Sparrow(), Crow()]
     for bird in birds:
         bird.make_sound()
         # Output:
         # Chirp chirp
         # Caw caw
     ```

These four principles form the foundation of OOP and help in writing **modular, flexible, and maintainable** code. They allow developers to model real-world entities more effectively and manage the complexity of large software systems.
